# ğŸ§± Libft | My First Personal C Library ğŸ“šâœ¨

Welcome to my **Libft** project, a compilation of my **own standard C library** functions built from scratch â€” because who needs to `strcpy` when you can write your own? ğŸ’ª

---

## ğŸ“˜ What Is Libft?

Libft is a **collection of functions** written in pure C that replicate (and extend) the functionality of the standard C library.  
Some of the contents that I tackled are:

- ğŸ”¡ Character checks (`ft_isalpha`, `ft_isdigit`, etc.)
- ğŸ§  Memory handling (`ft_memcpy`, `ft_memset`, `ft_calloc`)
- ğŸ”¤ String manipulation (`ft_strlen`, `ft_strjoin`, `ft_split`, etc.)
- ğŸ“„ File descriptors (`ft_putchar_fd`, `ft_putstr_fd`)
- ğŸ†• Bonus: Linked list functions
